    <h1>HI SEEMUU</h1>
    <H2>BEEN WORKING ON THIS NEW THEORY THAT HIT ME LAST NIGHT</H2>
    <h3>General theory of relativity extended to electromagnetic field</h3>
    <p>Consider the space between here and somewhere far far away. The space expands with the passage of earth time. Lights red shift.
        The energy of a light wave is a function of both it's amplitude and frequency. To maintain conservation of mass-energy, either mass must create, or the amplitude must increase.</p>
       <P> In the special case where mass isn't created, it may be possible that it's not the amplitude that increases, but the electro-magnetic field that collapses to treat the wave as larger...</P>
        <P>Gravity does not just bend space time only, it also bends electro-magnetic strength field.</p>
